Post to discussions about any debuggers or other things with build steps not on nixpkgs,

so that others may easily import that debugger/lsp/dependency/whatever they've been wanting as well!

The main drawback to using nix for nvim is when the thing is not on nixpkgs and has a hard build step.

So, again, when you figure a derivation out, regardless of what nvim related thing it is, post it to discussions!!!

First person to find a semi general way for building vscode debuggers not on nixpkgs
gets credited as a contributor if they want. Sorry I have no more to offer.

Outside of that, clone or fork the repo and do as you please, 
but adding plugins and bells and whistles to main gets in the way of the kickstarter spirit.

I would like to add 1 custom built vscode debugger that wasnt on nixpkgs as an example.

I would like to add a formatter or linter setup for 1 language as an example.

After that this repo will simply be recieving maintenance and be kept up to date.
